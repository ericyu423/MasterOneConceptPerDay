note: scrollView usually need content size, so once u add the content in scroll view can move around

Normal View:

View
  View  //constraint to all edges
     View  //constraint to all edeges
Warning 0: everything is good


view(UIView)
   scrollView(UIScroll)  //constraint to all edges
        contentView(UIView)  //constraint to all edeges)
        
warning 2: Need constraints for X position or width, Need constraints for Y position or height


what happen

scroll view need to have content width and heights speicified.

so once we added a subview it notice it does not have a width and height.

fixing the problem.
step 1.  let content width = the size of view width

view.width = context.width -> scrollView width is now set to view width  
// basically we tell scroll view to set it width to content's width

*we can set the width of scroll view to main view is pretty much the same thing (the point is to give width to the scroll view)


step 2. once the width is we only have 1 warning left "Need constraints for Y position or height"

to stretch scrollable area set the bottom of label to the bottom of context view.

#  Reason as the size of label grow you strech the height of the content
