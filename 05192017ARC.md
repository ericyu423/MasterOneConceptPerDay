# ARC - Review


#  CASE 1 -  as long as there is a reference it is not deallocated

class Person {
    deinit {
        print("person is being deinitialized")
    }
}
var ref1:Person?

ref1 = Person()
var ref2 = ref1
var ref3 = ref2
ref1 = nil
ref2 = nil
ref3 = nil -> "person is being deinitialized"



#  CASE 2  - is actually the same as case one...just that the example is compolicated

john have two pointers pointing at himself
so john = nil does not deallocate john
unit1 also have two pointer pointing at himself 
so unit1 = nil does not deallocate unit1


#  "Weak" to solve this problem we 

weak pretty much is just an weak pointer that is ignored by ARC so in the bottom case
unit1 actually only have one pointer pointing at himself
unit1 = nil deallocates it

Also notice

if you just do  john = nil it does not deallocate john
there is still tenant pointing at john



          class Person {
              weak var apartment: Apartment?
              deinit { print("person is being deinitialized") }
          }

          class Apartment {

              var tenant: Person?
              deinit { print("Apartment is being deinitialized") }
          }
          var john: Person?
          var unit1: Apartment?

          john = Person()
          unit1 = Apartment()

          john!.apartment = unit1  //john reference to object Apartment
          unit1!.tenant = john   //unit4A reference to object John

          john = nil
          unit1 = nil

# unowned -  Think of it the same as weak

john have two things pointing at himselve, but one of them is invisible so you can't get rid of it

john create a creadit card, that point back to john himself
so john have 2 things pointing at him and there is no way to get rid of Creditcard 
because there is no reference variable, in this case we use "weak" but weak give you a run time error
so we use unowned

      class Customer {
          let name: String
          var card: CreditCard?
          init(name: String) {
              self.name = name
          }
          deinit { print("\(name) is being deinitialized") }
      }

      class CreditCard {
          let number: UInt64
          unowned let customer: Customer
          init(number: UInt64, customer: Customer) {
              self.number = number
              self.customer = customer
          }
          deinit { print("Card #\(number) is being deinitialized") }
      }

      var john: Customer?
      john = Customer(name: "John Appleseed")
      john!.card = CreditCard(number: 1234_5678_9012_3456, customer: john!)


      //john pointing to customer
      //card pointing to creditcard

      john = nil
      
      
 #  unowned problem
 
 //var capitalCity: City! let capitalCity able to have nil as initial value
 
         class Country {
            let name: String
            var capitalCity: City!
            init(name: String, capitalName: String) {
                self.name = name
                self.capitalCity = City(name: capitalName, country: self)
            }
            deinit{
                print("country deinitted")
            }
        }

        class City {
            let name: String
            unowned let country: Country
            init(name: String, country: Country) {
                self.name = name
                self.country = country
            }
        }

        var country = Country(name: "Canada", capitalName: "Ottawa")
        
 #   country = nil actually give you error...perhaps a bug       
 
 
 
 
 #  IMPORTANT
 #  IMPORTANT
 
 #  CLOSURES 

        country = nil
