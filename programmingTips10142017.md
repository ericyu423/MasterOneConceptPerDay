#Splitting up a task

* large tasks are metnally taxing 
* When you can split the task it means, you know exactly the steps you need to take


Example read/write/edit icalendars

General 

task1. learn how icalendar works (user)
task2. learn how to write event to calendar
task3. learn how to create a new calendar (I didn't know you can create different calendars till i learn how to use icaldendar)

Write

task1. learn how to read a particular event (turn out you can use id or predicate)
task2. learn how to fetch particular caldendar (is it possible, if so how?)
task3. learn how to delete calendar and make sure all event associated with it are deleted
task4. learn how to delete events base on id
task5. learn how to store ID (userdefault will be the easiest)

Edit

task1. learn how to edit without creating duplicate


intergrate in to the app

task1. figure out how to code write appropriate class and functions

Unit test.

unit test each tasks

Now that we have an outline and we can clearly see that each task are pretty easy to do by itself
the task seems pretty easy, now we can relax our brain which will make us function more effciently.
